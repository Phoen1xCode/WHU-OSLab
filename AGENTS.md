# AI Assistant Guide

This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants when working with code in this repository. Adherence to these guidelines is crucial for maintaining code quality and consistency.

## Guiding Principles (MUST FOLLOW)

- **Keep it clear**: Write code that is easy to read, maintain, and explain.
- **Match the house style**: Reuse existing patterns, naming, and conventions.
- **Search smart**: Prefer `ast-grep` for semantic queries; fall back to `rg`/`grep` when needed.
